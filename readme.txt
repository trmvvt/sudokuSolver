Sudoku Solver
Implement a KenKen puzzle solver. This includes (1) formulating a representation for KenKen puzzles as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and (2) coding a backtracking algorithm to solve arbitrary KenKen puzzles. You should implement the variant of the backtracking that returns all possible solutions for a given puzzle. You are then asked to use your implementation to solve several puzzles and answer questions about them.
HyperSudoku Solver with two domain-independent heuristics for CSPs. One is called the "most constrained variable" (or MRV = Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic and the other is the "least constraining value" heuristic.
